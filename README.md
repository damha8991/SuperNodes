PythonTrees is a Python package that creates tree data structures easily.
It is designed to be similar to Python dictionaries but with extra
but with more functionality. The trees can be either used:
* For storing data
* As decision trees
* Both for storing data and as decision trees.

```python
from pythontrees import DataNode

main_node = DataNode(name="main")
```
